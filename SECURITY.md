## Reporting a Vulnerability

Use this section to tell people how to report a vulnerability.

Tell them where to go, how often they can expect to get an update on a
reported vulnerability, what to expect if the vulnerability is accepted or
declined, etc.

If you found any vulnerability, you can send a report it to: 
eraswaptechnologies@gmail.com.

Every month, tokens are released from a smart contract for maintaining 
the ecosystem, which are spendable through governance. You can become 
eligible for earning bounty tokens if you do not take advantage of the 
finding and report to the maintaining team. You can earn higher bounty 
for a more descriptive report.
